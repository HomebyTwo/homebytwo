  <h2 class="mrgt"->How does it work?</h2>
  <ul class="list-stacked list-stacked--divided">
    <li>We calculate your <strong>individual performance profile</strong> based on your Strava history. The performance profile is an estimation of how fast you move in relation to the steepness of the terrain.</li>
    <li>You can import any route from Strava or Switzerland mobility. For each route, Homebytwo proposes <strong>checkpoints</strong> based on places found along the course. You can choose which ones to include in your schedule.</li>
    <li>The <strong>estimated schedule</strong> is based on your performance profile. During the activity, you see how you are doing against your plan at every checkpoint.</li>
    <li>Tell <strong>Homebytwo</strong> when you started the activity and it will tell you how you are comparing to your schedule based on where you are. No need for an app in the background.</li>
</ul>
